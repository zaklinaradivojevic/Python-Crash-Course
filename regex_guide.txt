)        Indicates where string extraction is to end

Before you can use regular expresions in your program,you
must import the library using "import re"

You can use re.search() to see if the string maches a regular
expression similar to find() method for strings

You can use re.findall() to extract portion of a string that match
your regular expression,similar to a combination of find() and 
slicing : var[5:10]
